Programming_Cheat_Sheets
========================
These are cheat sheets I'm making as I learn new languages. They are mostly to help me
remember syntax because syntax from language to language can get tricky. I have included/will
include some simple sample code for each language to show some syntax in action. This may
also become a github repo filled with random bits of code that don't deserve their own
project. Maybe someone else will find this helpful, but maybe not. 

Haskell
=======
I am creating the Haskell cheat sheet while following [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/).
I am maybe halfway through this amazing guide, so don't expect some super complete, amazing
cheat sheet quite yet. There is also no exmple code so far.


Octave
======
I am creating an [Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) cheat sheet while taking 
[Stanford's/Coursera Machine Learning class](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml)
The example code currently consists of a Linear Regression program I wrote based on what
I learned in the class.
